This project focuses on the analysis of drug-related data to gain insights into drug classes, medical conditions, side effects, and other relevant parameters using data visualization and management tools. The dataset used contains information about various drugs, including columns such as Drug Name, Drug Class, Medical Condition, Dosage Form, Route of Administration, Side Effects, Manufacturer, and Price. The backend data is stored and managed using MySQL, while php is used to develop a user-friendly application for data entry and management. The frontend visualizations are created using Tableau, where multiple graphs and charts represent key insights, including the top 10 drugs by price, the most common side effects, and the distribution of drug classes. This project aims to provide a comprehensive analysis of drug data to help understand drug classifications, their associated conditions, and their pricing, as well as to identify patterns and trends in side effects.The successful integration of database management with dynamic visualizations highlights the importance of data analysis in the healthcare sector, providing a solid framework for future decision-making and research on drug efficacy and safety.
